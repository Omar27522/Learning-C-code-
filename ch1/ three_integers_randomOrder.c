/* 1.4.4	Three integers are entered in random order into the computer. 

Your task is to display the numbers in ascending order.

Using the problem-solving methodology, present an algorithm for ordering three numbers.

Your al- gorithm should be presented in pseudocode.



1.	read 3 integers 
2.	if firstN > secondN set firstN as bigger, and 			secondN as smaller. else set secondN as 			bigger and firstN as smaller.

3.	if smaller > thirdN set thirdN as smallest.
		else set smaller as smallest and thirdN as 			smaller.
		
4.	if bigger > smaller printf bigger smaller 					smallest. else print smaller bigger smallest. 

I know this pseudo is kinda dopy but I think it works. maybe there is a better approach.
